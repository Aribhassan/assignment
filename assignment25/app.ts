// Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.


// if statement to test whether the alienâ€™s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
let alien_color: string = 'green';

// another version of same programe that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)
let alien_color2: string = 'yellow'; // This alien's color is not green

if (alien_color2 === 'green') {
