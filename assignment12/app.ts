// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names:string[] = ["ahmed", "abrar", "anas", "usman"];
console.log(`Hello ${names[0]}, are you learning typescript or not?`);
console.log(`Hello ${names[1]}, are you learning typescript or not?`);
console.log(`Hello ${names[2]}, are you learning typescript or not?`);
console.log(`Hello ${names[3]}, are you learning typescript or not?`);
