// Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

    "abrar",
    "anas",
    "usman"
  ];

        console.log(`Dear ${guestName}, you are invited to dinner! please join us.`);
